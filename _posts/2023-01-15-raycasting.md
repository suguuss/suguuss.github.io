# Introduction

The goal of this project was to learn rust by making a simple raycasting implementation and compiling it to web assembly.

## Raycasting

Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D view in a 2D window. We can fake this perspective by drawing smaller walls the furter they are from the camera.
