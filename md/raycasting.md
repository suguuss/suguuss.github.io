# Introduction

I was inspired to make this project when I saw a video on youtube about raycasting. The website [technopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/21614/ray-casting) defines raycasting as follows : 

> Ray casting is a rendering technique used in computer graphics and computational geometry. It is capable of creating a three-dimensional perspective in a two-dimensional map. 

It was used in old games such as Wolfenstein 3D.
